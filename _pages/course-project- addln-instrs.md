### Course project additional instructions 

These additional instructions are issued since several students sought clarity on various aspects of the course project. 

## Your course project involves development of a static web page.
### So what is a static web page ?
A static website is a website where the website content remains fixed and is the same for every visitor and does not change dynamically based on user input or database interaction. An example would be my website [https://jim79.github.io/](https://jim79.github.io/). The pages of a static website are pre-built and served as-is to the user's browser without requiring server-side processing.

#### Key Features of a Static Website:
- Fixed Content – The content does not change unless manually updated by a developer.
- Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript – No need for server-side scripting like PHP, Node.js, or Python.

Common examples of static websites include resume websites, portfolio websites, brochure websites, landing pages (_similiar to like mine_) [https://jim79.github.io/jim/] (https://jim79.github.io/jim/) , Documentation pages, and other informational or read-only sites. 

### What is a Dynamic Website?
A dynamic website is a site where the content changes based on user interactions, preferences, or real-time data. It uses server-side processing and databases to generate web pages dynamically instead of serving pre-built HTML files.
Websites like Facebook or IRCTC on the otherhand are dynamic websites

#### Key Features of a Dynamic Website
- Content Updates Automatically – Pages change based on user behavior, database updates, or API calls.
- Server-Side Processing – Uses programming languages like PHP, Python, Node.js, or ASP.NET.
- Database-Driven – Fetches data from databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, or MongoDB.
- User Interaction – Supports logins, forms, comments, and personalized content.

Some examples of dynamic website are : Social media websites (Facebook, Instagram, Twitter), e-commerce websites (Amazon, Flipkart), travel websites (IRCTC, Air India), Banking websites (SBI, Federal Bank etc), KTU website.
 
As already mentioned **your course project involves development of a static web page** 
- Only html, css, javascript
- no databases
- no server-side processing
- you host your webpage on your PC or on free online platforms like [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/),[netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), [vercel](https://vercel.com/)

## So, how to learn building a static website ?
1. Basically what ever you learn in the module 4 of the course is sufficient to build a simple, functional static webpage. I have copied the contents of module 4 below.

_Web Design (Basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) – Understanding the web content delivery, Understanding HTML and XHTML Connections,Understanding Cascading Style Sheets, Understanding JavaScript_

2. Additionally there are plenty of free online resources and youtube links available for you to get started with html, css and javascript. I have listed below few of them.
[https://www.w3schools.com/html/](https://www.w3schools.com/html/) /
[https://www.w3schools.com/js/](https://www.w3schools.com/js/)

And probably the best resource for web development would be 
[https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web)

Personally, I use a CSS framework called bulma css [https://bulma.io/](https://bulma.io/) to add CSS elements to static pages. There are other css frameworks like Tailwind CSS [https://tailwindcss.com/](https://tailwindcss.com/)

A static site built by me using bulma css framework [https://jim79.github.io/co-po-mapping/)](https://jim79.github.io/co-po-mapping/). The webpage uses javascript to update the values entered into the various fields/boxes in the webpage.

## Do I need to buy a laptop or PC to do the course project
* Computing facilty available in the Department Computing Facility(DCF)/College Computing Facility (CCF) can be used for the course project. CCF is open on all working days till 9.00 pm
* Alternatively students can make use of the web browser based platforms like [https://github.dev](https://github.dev/) to develop the website code **from your mobile phone**.

### So get started, don't get overwhelmed by the links and youtube channels shared by your classmates to learn web development. To keep things simple just begin with the above resources and refer others as and when needed.
